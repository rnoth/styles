globaldark.css is a modified version of stormi's ``Global dark style'' from

the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

notable changes:
	- I have made an effort to make the css readable by formatting blocks,
	  and other such things.
	- a few blocks are commented out for taste or function reasons
	- code blocks are rendered in green instead of red

caveats:
	- the purpose of the css is to make the web comfortable to use in an
	  otherwise black/green-themed setup, rather than to be strictly
	  aestheticaly pleasing. the css is only just good enough that
	  I do not feel compelled to tweak it further
